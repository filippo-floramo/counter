# Description
This project is built with HTML5, SCSS and JS.
This is my first project that implements javascript.
You can find it here: 

It is a modern designed online counter with some features in it such as:
- Editable counter's name.
- Save and reset the count.

The counter decrement has a set limit, it cannot go below zero.
New features will be added as I keep learning new things.
